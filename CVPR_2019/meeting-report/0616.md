## Topics in Vision and Language
-  Grounding, Diversity and Author Anonymity
- [Bernt Schiele](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z76PBfYAAAAJ&hl=en)

### Grounding Language in Visual Data (ECCV16)
#### Grounding task

#### Localization Supervision
 - supervised
 - **semi-**
 - un-
 
#### GroundeR: Grounding by Reconstruction
 - unsupervised
 - reconstruction from attented image region, reconstruction loss
  
#### Evaluation:
 - Dataset: Flickr30k
 - semi-supervised better than supervised
---

### Aiming for higher diversity in captioning
#### Image Captioning task

#### Current SOTA Methods
- Generic and safe vocabulary is used

#### Our Approcah
- Use GAN to model human caption distribution

- Results: More diversity; on-par with SOTA methods accruacy

#### Key Ingredients
- Enforcing diversity explicity: discriminator see a set of captions; decide real/fake by image-caption and caption-image correlations
- deal with discrete 

#### Results
- Performs well on human evaluation
- better matching the N-gram distribution

### Author attribute anonymity (A4NT)
#### Ahthorship attribution
- identity
- gender
- age

#### Goal
- hide identity of the authors
- preserve the meaning

#### obfuscation
- Similiar to the machine-translation

#### solution
- loss function: attribute classifier; language model; semantic consistency
- attribution classifier: gan; (classifier to classify the attibute; another to fool it)
- semantic consistency: cycle consistency

#### Datasets and Results

- blog authorship corps
- Obama to Trump

## Paper1 show and tell
- [Show, Control and Tell:A Framework for Generating Controllable and Grounded Captions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10652.pdf)

### Introduction
- Image feature vector for image captioning
- Early: global
- Advanced 


### Controllable Image captioning
- so far: word level
- our: noun-chunks
- different captions -> different chunks -> different regions

- finetune using reinforcement learning
- network for sorting

### Results and dataset
- diversity
- controlling with a sequence of regions
- COCO; Semi-automatically annotated

## Paper2 Generating Diverse and Informative Natural Language Fashion Feedback
- [Generating Diverse and Informative Natural Language Fashion Feedback](http://languageandvision.com/)

### Introduction
- Image captioning on fashine domain

### Dataset
- Created a dataset with GOOD and TIP label annotated by fashion specialist
- Challenges: visual difference is small; answer diversity is small

### Architecture
- detecter; encoder; decoder
- encoder: sequence encoder
- decoding with maximum mutual information (MMI)

## Paper3 A Coherence Approach to Data-Driven Inference in Visual Communication
- [A coherence approach to data-driven inference in visual communication](http://languageandvision.com/)

### Overview
- discourse

- learning how textual cues guide image interpretations
- learning what information is in the image or text

### Related work
- machine conprehension
- text summarizaion

### discourse relations in image-text presentation

### Data collection
- crowdsourcing experiemnt
- relations 

### Analysis
- information across modalities

### Diagram
- diagram structures
- arrows

---
## Spotlight1
### Deep Sentiment Features of Context, Faces and Text for Affective Video Analysis
- Extract faces from the video
- Using the sentiment information

### Dense Relational Captioning: Triple-Stream Networks for Relationship-Based Captioning
- Relationship-based captioning

### Others
- Few-shot object recognition from semantic information
- Chart question answering (CQA)


### Curvature: A signature for Action Recognition in Video Sequences

### Image Captioning with Integrated Bottom-Up and Multi-level Residual Top-Down Attention for Game Scene Understanding
- Top-down attention from game scene image captioning

### Image captioning with weakly-supervised attention penalty
- geometic 

### Let's Transfer Text Transformations to Images
- image transformation by text

### Answer Them All! Toward Universal Visual Question Answering Models
- 5 approaches on 8 datasets
- approaches which achieve high accuracy on CG dataset perform bad on real dataset;
- approaches which achieve high accuracy on real dataset perform bad on CG dataset.

## Devi Parikh
- Forcing Vision + Language Models to 

- Challenge: grounding

### Image Captioning
- baby talk (2011)
- neural baby talk (2018)

### Neural baby talk
- Novel object captioning
- Critical for real world scenarios
- Ties Vision + Language problem to classical vision problems

### Visual Question Answering: Pythia (2018 Challenge Champion)
- Visual Question Answering Analysis (EMNLP2016) -> biases in VQA models
- VQA-CP Dataset
- VQA-GVQA: deal with the VQA-CP dataset (recognize what is the relevant image region; detect the relevant answer space; predict answer)

### Visual Question Answering: Reading
- TVQA
- LoRRA

### Visual Question Answering: Consistency
- Question Consistancy; Answer Consistency
- VQA Rephrasing Dataset
- Cycle-consistent framework(agnostic to VQA/VQA models; improved VQA/VQG)

### Summary So Far
- challenges grounding and generalization
- forcing models to look
- counter language priors via: datasets;...
- human-in-the-loop evaluation accuracy is not the goal; performance of human-AI team is

### Human-AI Connection (Language)
#### Machine Teaching (teach human to learn)
- no explainations
- visual explainations
- counter.** explainations

#### creative AI
- word -> theme

## Andrei Barbu
- How language enables intelligence: Reducing

### Recognition
- P(sentence, video)

### Retrieval
- SENTENTIAL 

### Others tasks
- generation
- question answering
- disambiguation
- language acquisition (learn language like children; language and video to a structure)
- paraphrasing (paraphrasing with vision)
- translation 
- command following (planning; prformance on dataset is not predictive of real-world performance, even on other datasets)
- Common sense reasoning
- Planning

### How do we solve new problems?
- ??

## Paper 4 Visual Discourse Parsing (VDP)
- [Visual Discourse Parsing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02252.pdf)
- Text-Level Discourse Parsing
- Given a video, parse the scene's relation with the context

### Applications of VDP
- video summarization
- video paragraph captioning
- visual sentiment analysis
- visual dialog and visual story-telling

### VDP Data Collection
- 310 videos
- 19 sec / video
- mannual annotated
- various places in UCLA

### Ongoing efforts and challenge
- annotation aggrement
- scaling up datasets by leveraging exisiting datasets
