## Topics in Vision and Language
-  Grounding, Diversity and Author Anonymity
- [Bernt Schiele](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z76PBfYAAAAJ&hl=en)

### Grounding Language in Visual Data (ECCV16)
#### Grounding task

#### Localization Supervision
 - supervised
 - **semi-**
 - un-
 
#### GroundeR: Grounding by Reconstruction
 - unsupervised
 - reconstruction from attented image region, reconstruction loss
  
#### Evaluation:
 - Dataset: Flickr30k
 - semi-supervised better than supervised

### Aiming for higher diversity in captioning
#### Image Captioning task

#### Current SOTA Methods
- Generic and safe vocabulary is used

#### Our Approcah
- Use GAN to model human caption distribution

- Results: More diversity; on-par with SOTA methods accruacy

#### Key Ingredients
- Enforcing diversity explicity: discriminator see a set of captions; decide real/fake by image-caption and caption-image correlations
- deal with discrete 

#### Results
- Performs well on human evaluation
- better matching the N-gram distribution

### Author attribute anonymity (A4NT)
#### Ahthorship attribution
- identity
- gender
- age

#### Goal
- hide identity of the authors
- preserve the meaning

#### obfuscation
- Similiar to the machine-translation

#### solution
- loss function: attribute classifier; language model; semantic consistency
- attribution classifier: gan; (classifier to classify the attibute; another to fool it)
- semantic consistency: cycle consistency

#### Datasets and Results

- blog authorship corps
- Obama to Trump

## Paper1 show and tell
- [Show, Control and Tell:A Framework for Generating Controllable and Grounded Captions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10652.pdf)

### Introduction
- Image feature vector for image captioning
- Early: global
- Advanced 


### Controllable Image captioning
- so far: word level
- our: noun-chunks
- different captions -> different chunks -> different regions

- finetune using reinforcement learning
- network for sorting

### Results and dataset
- diversity
- controlling with a sequence of regions
- COCO; Semi-automatically annotated
