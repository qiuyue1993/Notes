## oral session1
- Best Student Award：
 - Reinforced Cross-Modal Matching and Self-supervised Imitation Learning for Vision-Language Navigation

### SDRSAC: Semidefinite-Based Randomized Approach for Robust Point Cloud Registration Without Correspondences
- rigid body transformation
- do not extracting key point
- graph matching
- outperform other methods in terms of consensus sizes

### BAD SLAM: Bundle Adjusted Direct RGB-D SLAM
- direct bundle adjust to direct SLAM in real-time
- eth3d framework
- very good performance

**Impressive Results**

### Revealing Scenes by Inverting Structure From Motion Reconstructions
- sfm
- 3d map inversion
- Visibnet
- RefineNet
- input increases the performance will advance

- **Impressive**
- **poster 74**

### Strand-Accurate Multi-View Hair Capture
- reconstruct hair
- digital avatars often lacks realistic hairs
- key: 3d line and orientation-consistency
- Pipeline: input->line-based multiview stereo->hair strand reconstruction->hair growing->output

### DeepSDF: Learning Continuous Signed Distance Functions for Shape Representation
- key idea: directly regression of sdf(signed distance function)
- code??
- Varient Auto-Encoder

- **Impressive Results**

### Pushing the Boundaries of View Extrapolation With Multiplane Images
- predict + render 
- MPI


### GA-Net: Guided Aggregation Net for End-To-End Stereo Matching
- matching cost aggregation
- formulate traditional to DNN

### Real-Time Self-Adaptive Deep Stereo
- depth estimation
- fine tuning on real data
- time cost efficiency

### LAF-Net: Locally Adaptive Fusion Networks for Stereo Confidence Estimation
- stereo matching
- matching cost 
- tri-modal input


### NM-Net: Mining Reliable Neighbors for Robust Feature Correspondences
- select consistent correspondences from initial corespondence
- importance of local information
- compatibility-specific knn
- multiple consistencies

### Coordinate-Free Carlsson-Weinshall Duality and Relative Multi-View Geometry
- scene points and pinholes play almost symmetric roles
- geometric points and lines


### Deep Reinforcement Learning of Volume-Guided Progressive View Inpainting for 3D Point Scene Completion From a Single Depth Image
- scene completion from a single depth image
- former works output low resolution results

- key idea: transform the 3D completion task to multi-view 2D depth map inpainting tasks
- volume-guided view inpainting　
- DQN-based view selection
