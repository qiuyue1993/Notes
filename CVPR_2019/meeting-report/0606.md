### Grounding Language in Visual Data (ECCV16)
#### Grounding task

#### Localization Supervision
 - supervised
 - **semi-**
 - un-
 
#### GroundeR: Grounding by Reconstruction
 - unsupervised
 - reconstruction from attented image region, reconstruction loss
  
#### Evaluation:
 - Dataset: Flickr30k
 - semi-supervised better than supervised


### Aiming for higher diversity in captioning
#### Image Captioning task

#### Current SOTA Methods
- Generic and safe vocabulary is used

#### Our Approcah
- Use GAN to model human caption distribution

- Results: More diversity; on-par with SOTA methods accruacy

#### Key Ingredients
- Enforcing diversity explicity: discriminator see a set of captions; decide real/fake by image-caption and caption-image correlations

- deal with discrete
