### Introduction
**Tasks**
- The requester may not know how to navigate to the target objects and thus **makes requests by only specifying high-level endgoals**.
- The agent is **capable of sensing when it is lost** and querying an advisor.

---
### Future Work
- Provide more natural, **fully linguistic question and answer interactions** between advisor and agent.
- Investigating how to transfer **from simulators to real-world robots**.
