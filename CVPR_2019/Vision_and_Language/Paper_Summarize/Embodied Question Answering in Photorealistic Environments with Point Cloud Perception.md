### Introduction
**Abstract**
- Instantiate a large-scale navigation task - Embodied Question Answering in photo-realistic environments (**Matterport 3D**)
- Throughout study navigation policies utilizing **3D point clouds**, **RGB images**, their **combination**

**Key findings**
- Forward-only or random navigation baselines are strong navigators on **EQA evaluation metrics**
- A novel loss-weighting scheme **Inflection Weighting** is important in training recurrent models for navigation with **behavior cloning**
- Point clouds provide a richer signal than RGB images for learning **obstacle avoidance**

---
### Conclusion
- EXtend EQA to **photorealistic environments**
- Propose the **MP3D-EQA** v1 dataset
- **End-to-end** trainable navigation model for **3D point clouds**
- Novel weighting scheme - **Inflection Weighting** increases the effectiveness of behavior cloning
- **Random and forward-only** are strong under EQA evaluation setting
