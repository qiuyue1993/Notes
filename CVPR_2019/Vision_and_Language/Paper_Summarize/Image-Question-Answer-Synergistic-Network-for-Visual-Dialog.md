### Introduction
**Abstract**
- Propose a **image-question-answer synergistic** network to value the **role of the answer** for precise visual dialog.
- Propose a **two-stage** solution:
- Stage 1: candidate answers are **coarsely scored** according to their relevance to the image and question pair.
- Stage 2: answers with high probability of being correct are **re-ranked** by synergizing with image and question.
- We also **improve the N-pair loss function to solve the class-imbalanced problem** in the discriminative model.
