### Introduction
#### Abstract
- We ﬁrst present a standard CNN architecture trained to recognize the shapes’ rendered views independently of each other, and show that
a 3D shape can be recognized even from **a single view** at an accuracy far **higher than** using state-of-the-art **3D shape descriptors**.
