### Asynchronous Single-Photon 3D Imaging
- Black Bean
- Computer Vision in Low Light
- A system: extreme sensitivity
- Low-light imaging
- Time of flight 3D Cameras
- Single-photon 3D camera
- capable of extreme dark circumanstances
- Sunlight
- using strong sensor is not useful
- add some block ---
- if not?
- key observation
- higher probability of detecting signal photos after sensor start
- main idea: asynchronous operation (1000 shifts -> peak easily detected)
- towards long-range high-resolution 3D cameras (low light)

### Specifying Object Attributes and Relations in Interactive Scene Generation
- object:class, relationships, size and location, appearance
- interactive environment

Processes

### PLMP-Point line minimal problems in complete multi-view visibility
- 3d reconstructions from 2d image
- calibrated perspective cameras 
- minimal problem
- 5 point problem is minimal
- 3D reconstruction -> definition of minimal

- 30 complete visibility problem

### SinGAN: Learning a Generative Model from a Single Natural Image
- single image gan
- former works only generate texture
- SinGAN: many tasks (same model, no extra training)
