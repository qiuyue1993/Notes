- Feature Representations, Similarity Learning

### Sampling-Free Epistemic Uncertainty Estimation Using Approximated Variance Propagation
- Aleatoric vs epistemic (type of uncertainty)
- Epistemic uncertainty for large neural networks
- Very low and stable runtime

### Universal Adversarial Perturbation via Prior Driven Uncertainty Approximation
- Universal adversarial perturbation
- Key: how to estimate uncertainty

### Understanding Deep Networks via Extremal Perturbations and Smooth Masks
- A method seems better than grad-cam
- Extremal pertubations

### Unsupervised Pre-Training of Image Features on Non-Curated Data
- Learning representations
- Unsupervised pre-training
- RotNet, deepcluster
- deeper cluster

### Learning Local Descriptors With a CDF-Based Dynamic Soft Margin
- triplet loss for descriptor learning 
- problem with static hard margin
- static soft margin
- Solution: dynamic soft margin
- vs. hardnet (2017)

### Bayes-Factor-VAE: Hierarchical Bayesian Deep Auto-Encoder Models for Factor Disentanglement
- unsupervised representation learning
- Factor-VAE (2018)
- complex model tend to explore prior 

### Linearized Multi-Sampling for Differentiable Image Transformation
- Optimizing to align images
- Pitfalls of bilinear sampling
- Better gradients for linear
- Leads to better classification

### AdaTransform: Adaptive Data Transformation
- Test data may have variations caused by purtubation
- Data augmentation
- Increasing data variation in training, decrease in the test period

### CARAFE: Content-Aware ReAssembly of FEatures
- Feature upsampling
- current: content-unaware, limited fov, computation cost

- capture information of object shape

### AFD-Net: Aggregated Feature Difference Learning for Cross-Spectral Image Patch Matching
- Cross-spectral image patches matching
- Previous word do not use low-level featuer,
- Propose: aggregate feature differences, metric learning

### Deep Joint-Semantics Reconstructing Hashing for Large-Scale Unsupervised Cross-Modal Retrieval
- image-text cross-modal retrival
- DJSRH
- every component contributes to the final result

### Unsupervised Neural Quantization for Compressed-Domain Similarity Search
- compress-domiain similarity search
- encoder-decoder, to latentcodebooks
- Gumble-softmax

### Siamese Networks: The Tale of Two Manifolds	
- Problem of siamese network

### Learning Combinatorial Embedding Networks for Deep Graph Matching
- Graph Matching
- Formulated as quadratic --- > NP hard
- Permutation loss
- Cross-graph conv

### Fashion Retrieval via Graph Reasoning Networks on a Similarity Pyramid
- Global similarity is disturbed by occlusions, misalignemnt
- Multi-scale, weighted sum
- Local and global similarity
