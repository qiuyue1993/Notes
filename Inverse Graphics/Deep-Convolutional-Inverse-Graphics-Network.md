### Introduction
**Overview**
- This paper presents the Deep Convolution Inverse Graphics Network (DC-IGN), a model that learns a **interpretable representation** of
images. This representation is **disentangled** with respect to transformations such as out-of-plane **rotations** and **lighting variations**.
- The DC-IGN model is composed of **encoder-decoder** structure and is trained using the **Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayers (SGVB)**.
