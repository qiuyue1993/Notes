### Introduction
**Overview**
- We propose a novel recurrent convolutional encoder-decoder network that is trained end-to-end on the task of **rendering rotated objects**
starting from a single image.
- The **recurrent** structure allows our model to capture **longterm dependencies** along a sequence of transformations.
