### Introduction
*Intuition*
- For **real-world visual reasoning**
- And **compositional** question answering

*GQA*
- Images come from Visual Genome dataset
- 1.7M questions after balancing
- Every question is generated from scene graph
- Every question have a function program that present questions' semantics
- Answer distribution and question biases are well controlled
- A series of evaluation metrics are proposed in this paper

*Contributions*
- The GQA dataset as a resource for **studying visual reasoning**
- Development of an effective method for generating a large number of semantically varied question, which marries scene graph representations with computational linguistic methods
- New **metrics for VQA** that allow for better assessment of system success and failure modes
