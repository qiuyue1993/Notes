### Introduction
- In this paper, we present a novel neural modular approach that performs compositional reasoning by automatically inducing a desired sub-task decomposition without relying on strong supervision. 
-  Experiments show that the model is more interpretable to human evaluators compared to other state-of-the-art models: users can better understand the model’s underlying reasoning procedure and predict when it will succeed or fail based on observing its intermediate outputs.
-  In this paper, we present a new model that makes use of an explicit, modular reasoning process, but which allows fully diﬀerentiable training with backpropagation and without expert supervision of reasoning steps.

### Conclusion
- In this paper, we have proposed a novel model for visual question answering and referential expression grounding. 
- Compared with previous modular approaches, our model induces a decomposition of the inference procedure into sub-tasks while not requiring expert layout supervision.
