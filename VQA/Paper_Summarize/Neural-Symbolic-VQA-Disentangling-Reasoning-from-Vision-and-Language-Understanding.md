### Introduction
**Abstract**:
- Our neural-symbolic VQA (NS-VQA) system first recovers a **structural scene representation** from the image and **program trace** from
the question. It then **excutes the program on the scene representation** to obtain answer.

**Advantages of incorporating symbolic structure as prior knowledge**:
- Robust to long program traces, thus can solve **complex reasoning** better.
- More data- and memory-**efficient**.
- Offering full **transparency** to the reasoning process.

### Discussion
- We have presented a **neural-symbolic VQA approach** that disentangles reasoning from visual perception and language understanding.
- Intergrating **unsupervised or weakly supervised representation learning** in both language and vision with our neural-symbolic approach to **visually grounded language** is a promising future direction.
