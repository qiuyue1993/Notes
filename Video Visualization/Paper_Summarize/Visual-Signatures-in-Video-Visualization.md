### Introduction
#### Video Visualization
- Video visualization is a **computation process** that extracts meaningful information from original video data sets and conveys the extracted information to users in appropriate visual representations.

#### Abstract visual representation of a video
- Depicting temporal information in a spatial geometric form.

#### Contributions
- For the first time, considered the **video visualization as a flow visualization problem**, in addition to a volume visualization.

###  Conclusions
- We found that the **flow-based visual signatures** were essential to certain the recognition of certain types of motion.
- In particular, in our field trail, **combined volume and flow visualization** was shown to be more the most effective means for conveying the underlying motion actions in real-life videos.
-  Some of the Ô¨Åndings obtained in this user study have also indicated the possibility that perspective projection in a video may not necessary be a major barrier, since human observers can recognize size changes at ease.
