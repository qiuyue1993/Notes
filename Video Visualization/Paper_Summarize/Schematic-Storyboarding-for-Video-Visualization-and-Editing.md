### Introduction
- Example of Schematic Storyboard



- We present a method for visualizing short video clips in a single staic image, using the visual language of storyboards.

#### Storyboard
- A sequence of still frames representing a moving sequence. 
- A Schematic storyboards are static but organized and annotated to convey continuity and directionality.

#### Contributions
- Introducing a formal summary of the visual language of storyboards as a tool for visualization, and incorporating many of these principles as part of a semi-automated layoutandrenderingsystem.

### Discussion
