### Introduction
Following an overview of the real-time 3D shape reconstruction method, we present
- an algorithm of generating texture on the 3D object surface from the multi-view video images
- an editing system for visualizing 3D video with an omnidirectional background image using versatile 3D camera works

---
### Conclusion
- We are proposing 3D video as new image media: it records the object's full 3D shape, motion, and surface properties (i.e. color and texture).
